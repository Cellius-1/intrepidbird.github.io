Alex Sheng (IntrepidBird)'s Personal Website

Current Version: **v.37.9.25**

> [!WARNING]  
> I intend to take the open-source database of this website **private and not accessible to the public user**. That being said, this GitHub repository is likely going to become a private repository before 4/6/2024, 11:59:59 PM Eastern Standard Time. I am still debating this with myself, but it's very likely going to happen. **You will still be able to access the website at https://intrepidbird.me, but will not have access to the open source repository or any of it's source code** (except the ones shown through Chrome Dev Tools). This is a personal decision, and for no explicit reason whatsoever. The last public version (if this plan goes through will be v.48.25.10, expecting to release this week. Thank you.
