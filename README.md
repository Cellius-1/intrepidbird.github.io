Alex Sheng (IntrepidBird)'s Personal Website

Current Version: **v.37.9.25**

----------------------------------------------

> [!WARNING]  
> I intend to take the open-source database of this website **private and make it not accessible to the public user**. That being said, this GitHub repository is likely (~67%) going to become a private repository before 4/6/2024, 11:59:59 PM Eastern Standard Time. I am still debating this with myself, but it's very likely going to happen. **You will still be able to access the website at https://intrepidbird.me, but will not have access to the open source repository or any of it's source code** (except the ones shown through Chrome Dev Tools). This is a personal decision, and for no explicit reason whatsoever. The last public version (if this plan goes through) will be v.48.25.10, expecting to release this week. **No project such as https://intrepidbird.me/graphing-calculator/ will have it's source code hidden from the public and they will all remain open sourced as of the current plan.** The Home, About Me, Projects Homepage, Blog, Blog Posts are amongst the many webpages that will no longer belong to open source. It is still possible (although a much smaller chance) that this website will be brought into open source again. Thank you.

Update: There is a **good chance** v.48.25.10 will **not come out in time** before the website's source code is taken off the internet.
