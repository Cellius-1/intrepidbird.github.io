                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm Alex Sheng, a Math Team Captain, Science Team Captain, and a Computer Science Club's co-founder. I enjoy doing math, and I have gotten outstandingly good results in prestigious competitions such as the MAA American Mathematics Competitions 8, and the American Mathematics Competitons 10. I've also represented my school 2 times for Mathcounts, and have won multiple CMLs, and Math Leagues. I've also participated in HMMT, PUMaC, and Gauss Math Tournament, with good scores. I continue to enjoy mathematics, and hope to make USAMO one day.</p>
