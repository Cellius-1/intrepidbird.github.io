    <h1>MAA Needs to Respond to the 2024 AMC 8 Leaks</h1>

        Alright. This is getting ridiculous now. The Mathematical Association of America needs to launch investigations into whoever decided to leak the AMC 8 and it's repercussions. This can't keep on happening and it's a serious issue with the integrity of the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, I would like to clarify that I already took the AMC 8 on 1/18/2024, and expect to get a full score of 25/25. I also took this math competition season's AMC 10, which was also plagued by a leak in the AMC 10A, which was a result of many mathematical Discord servers, Chinese social media website, Art of Problem Solving community members, and sketchy deals between math competition clubs and shady MAA proctors sharing the entire competition booklet with correct solutions before the test happened. A petition was filed on change.org, which gained thousands of signatures, but MAA didn't do anything about the situation, and instead just let the situation advance. The leak most likely affected a couple hundred people if not thousands of competitors and officials before getting shut down on AoPS and Discord. However, the social media leaks were not taken down within a reasonable amount of time according to most sources, and were key aspects in essentially 'rigging' the test.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation with the 2024 AMC 8 is very similar, having been leaked 1-2 days ago due to most sources, and has already been discussed and shared across YouTube, Discord, WeChat, Xiaohongshu, and other sources. AoPS has done a very good job in moderating the leaks, and hence no leaks have been found on the world's largest math forum, although the AoPS moderators have publically admitted that the leaks have already been widespread by this point. Asian parents and test takers have already gone to change.org to propose another petition, but I personally don't believe MAA has the finances or the power to instigate a investigation into the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my friends on my math competition team told me that a student who had taken the test was responsible for the leaks, and sold the information to a math competition club for money. Almost all the top scorers on my math team (including myself) are very concerned with the situation and we have signed the petition, but in my opinion MAA won't do anything about this test just like what it did for the AMC 10. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that there's still another three days to take the AMC 8 as I'm writing this, it could heavily sway the results of the test, and be a unfair advantage for the people who haven't taken it yet. I hope MAA will sort this situation out, because this is just ridiculous. I would say the below AoPS joke explains the MAA situation with AMC tests pretty well.

      Anyways, come on MAA...that's pretty bad for a governing organization. Somebody's got to look into this.
