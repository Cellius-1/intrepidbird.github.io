    <h1>MAA Needs to Respond to the 2024 AMC 8 Leaks</h1>

        Alright. This is getting pretty weird now. The Mathematical Association of America needs to launch investigations into the AMC 8 leaks and look into the potential repercussions it may or may not have caused. This can't keep on happening, and it's a serious issue with the integrity of the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, I would like to clarify that I already took the AMC 8 on 1/18/2024 and expect to get a full score of 25/25. I also took this year's AMC 10, which was also plagued by a leak in the AMC 10A. The leak was a result of many mathematical Discord servers, Chinese social media websites, Art of Problem Solving community members, and various other reasons that are unconfirmed. A petition was filed on change.org, which gained thousands of signatures, but MAA hasn't seemed to have taken major action yet. The leak most likely affected a couple hundred people, if not thousands, of competitors and officials before getting shut down on AoPS and Discord. However, I think that MAA should just have not let this situation happen in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        The situation with the 2024 AMC 8 is very similar, having been leaked 1-2 days ago due to most sources and having already been discussed and shared across various popular social media sites. AoPS has done a good job in moderating the leaks, and as of currently I believe that no leaks have been found on the world's largest math forum, although the AoPS moderators have publicly admitted that the leaks have already been widespread by this point. Parents and test takers have already gone to change.org to propose another petition, but I personally don't believe any major action will occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my friends on my math team told me that a student who had taken the test was responsible for the leaks and sold the information to a math competition club for money, although I have no confirmation on whether this is true or not, so take it with a grain of salt. It's nonetheless a confirmed leak, and impacted at least one person, which is already an integrity issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that there's still another three days to take the AMC 8 as of the time of this post, it could prompt integrity concerns (MAA I trust you guys with my life so don't do this). This post is basically just a rant because I can't do anything about it, but personally, if you do get the leak, there's no purpose in cheating on the AMC 8 besides trying to get bragging rights. What concerns me is that this happened on the AMC 10 as well, which is actually important (AIME is a bigger deal than AMC 8 by quite a bit).

      Edit: MAA has addressed the AMC 10 and AMC 8 leaks, and have been working forward to solve the issues. ＼(＾O＾)／
