    <h1>Introduction to IntrepidBird's Blogging Journey</h1>

<div class="container p-4">
    <p>
        Welcome to my first blog post! I am very happy and excited to start this new journey of sharing my experiences and thoughts on the internet through this blog! I will primarily utilize this blog to share my experiences, thoughts, and accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before I talk more about starting a blog, allow me to briefly introduce myself. I am Alex Sheng, aka IntrepidBird, and I enjoy math, science, and coding, amongst other things. You probably know me from STEM, or my main sport, which is ice hockey. You can learn more about me in my <a href="https://intrepidbird.me/about-me/">about me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting a blog has been a goal of mine ever since learning web development a couple of months ago. I created this blog for two reasons. The first reason was to test my HTML and CSS skills. I work mainly on the front-end with my hackathon team, so I personally like to challenge myself, and this blog and website are a perfect way to do so! I also like to share my opinions about math and STEM in multiple ways, and I found out that my AoPS blog just wasn't enough (although I still actively post on it).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this blog, I will be mainly be talking about my major and minor experiences with math, science, computer science, life, and sometimes even just random things that somehow have meaning to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will try my best to frequently update my blog with new information, and I hope to add new features over time. Cheers!
    </p>
