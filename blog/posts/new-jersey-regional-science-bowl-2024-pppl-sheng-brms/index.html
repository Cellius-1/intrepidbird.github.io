        The NJ State Regional Science Bowl just concluded on February 23rd, 2024. For context, my school only allows you to participate twice in this event (7th grade and 8th grade), and I made the First Team twice, and captained it the second time (5 people were picked each time out of a pool of ~60). This year's Science Bowl was held at PPPL in Princeton, as with years before. My team and I were going into this competition as last year's runner-ups (2nd out of 16 schools), and we were aiming for first this time. The Science Bowl is a double-elimination bracket competition, so if you lost twice you were out. The last team to lose twice is crowned the champion. Losing once meant you entered the One Loss or 'sudden death' bracket, which you could still not lose again and win, but it's better to just not lose so you will only have to win one match in the final instead of two.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the NJ Science Bowl was a 10/10. Our coaches were very supportive, the place was great, other teams were nice, and the people were great. We got off to a great start, by beating a team 90-8. Afterwards, I'm pretty someone on Lawrenceville said "We're about to play the team that Bridgewater just absolutely cooked". Too bad we cooked them next ðŸ˜‚. We had lunch next, which wasn't provided this year. After lunch (which involved cookies), we played Newark, which was actually a pretty strong team before we got into a rhythm and beat them too. At this point, only two teams (Bridgewater-Raritan (us) and Princeton Charter) still have a perfect record (out of 16 teams), and that meant we would have to play each other in the first semi-final (No Loss Bracket). The loser would enter the One Loss Bracket's final, and would still be in the final if they won that. So basically, we needed to win one match out of the next two.

        We were leading by three points against Princeton Charter by halftime in Semifinal A, but ended up losing as they gained momentum quickly and took most of the toss-up questions with their speed. It was kind of frustrating because we could answer all the questions, they were literally just faster by milliseconds. However, we went into Semifinal B needing to eliminate the other team (which would be third place), so we went in and absolutely dominated that match. This meant we were back in the finals for the second year in a row (our school has only reached the finals four times), and this time I was the captain. We ended up falling just short, but we were on a roll in the last three minutes or so, getting every single toss-up and their bonuses. It was a well-fought match however, and they deserved to win.
    </p>
    <p>
        That also means I've won second place (silver medal) two years in a row now, and have the most Science Bowl medals of all time from BRMS (2). In the end, we learned a lot through Science Bowl, and I really appreciate everyone who has helped me along the way.

        I would like to share some pictures of the brackets and the competition team.
