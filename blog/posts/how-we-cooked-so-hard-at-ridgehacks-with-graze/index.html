      My friends and I participated in RidgeHacks 2024 today. We came in 2nd out of 22 teams (which were pretty much all high school teams) with our application named 'Graze'. We were able to beat both teams from BRHS, our district's high school, and potentially secured the best hackathon performance in our district's history (let me know if this is wrong because this is based on limited information). With this accomplishment, we were able to win hundreds of dollars in prizes ($300-$500) and will get featured in the BRHS C.O.D.E. club's classroom. You can check out our GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/pointySphere/graze">here</a> and our Devpost submission <a href="https://devpost.com/software/graze">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's the story. So basically I arrived at Ridge High School at around 8:15, and I found that Dhruv was already there waiting for me. Then, Tharun joined us for the opening ceremony at around 8:30. We had breakfast at 9:00, and hacking began, which meant that we started working on our project 'Graze', which we had discussed and came up with before the hackathon so we would be prepared and wouldn't have to waste time once the 12 hours started.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dhruv built the simple version of the backend first, along with HTML code that functioned, but with no extra details or CSS. We then spent the next couple of hours making the user interface by editing the HTML, CSS, and adding in new pages, new functions, and new elements, such as the Gallery and information contained on the homepage. I added in the navigation bar, the homepage 'what is it?', the team members cards, along with a footer and other things for other pages of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        We then spent many hours fixing and revising this code, as we had to identify many many issues with the HTML, and sometimes the CSS would make our website look weird instead of accomplishing our goal. We then went through the many parts of our application step by step (the painful code review is real), and Dhruv learned about how to make multiple functions in Flask live during the hackathon.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the last few hours, we added in a gallery, where people could share their artwork instead of just uploading it to 'Graze'. Surprisingly, this was actually not too hard to make, and we got the HTML, CSS, and Flask working within the first 5 tries. I think the hardest pages were the authentication pages (Login and Sign Up), and the homepage (lots of information).
    </p>
    <p>
        We finalized our project by checking any bugs and removing them. We checked our code and wrote a paragraph in Devpost to finish off our project. We made sure everything was well, and deleted all the redundant code and organized it to be more concise.
    </p>
    <p>
        We had Tharun's friend, Calum, record our submission video, which I think turned out pretty well, and we submitted our code literally 2 minutes before the deadline. We then sat nervously, wondering if we would be in the top 5 (finalist). When everyone went to the auditorium, 'Graze' was called in the top five as a finalist (YES), and we had to make a presentation now on the spot in the next round of judging. We ended up talking about research, our code, how it works, and showing off our project and reviews. We actually thought we were going to finish in 4th place, so when we were called for 2nd place, we were very happy. We ended up getting prizes worth around $180 each, which is pretty cool I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        RidgeHacks 2024 was a great experience and I highly recommend it for all people.
