        On 2/3/2024, I competed in the MathCounts Chapter Competition, along with the likes of Kevin Long, Jay Fang, and Alan Ma. I think I scored a 27/30 on the Sprint Round (my best score), and a 14/16 on the Target Round (my best score), which puts me at 41/46 in total.
    </p>
    <p>
      This score was enough to place me at 9th out of 330+ Mathletes, and qualify into the next round, the Countdown round. First of all, I was very very happy about my Sprint Round, and I had a good feeling afterwards. My hopes only increased when I got a good Target Score, and the overall atmosphere was awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we had the Team Round, which I was a part of, because I was one of the top 4 in my team. I think we may have sold on this round, but I think I was a pretty good Captain. We got problems #8 and #10 wrong, for two different reasons. We actually solved #10, but when we doubled checked it, one of my teammates told me to change thre answer, which resulted in it being wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the entire lunch calculating my chances on making the Countdown round, eating a salad, and touring the college campus that it was held at. My coaches brought food and snacks, such as Oreos, and we were able to get the full experience of and sights and sounds of MathCounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the CountDown round came out, I heard my name called second (it's from #10 to #1), and it felt great. Imagine having like 300+ sweaty Asian Mathletes and their Asian parents clapping for you. It's a pretty good feeling. Two of my teammates also made this round. I went up against #10, and I beat him 2-1 (best of 3). I then lost the next round, but I did better than I expected, at least winning a round in the Countdown Round. We missed out on a team round trophy, and didn't win a 'triangle' ... but it's all good because I was able to beat over 10 AIME qualifiers, and that's good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, MathCounts was a 9.5/10, the only thing that could be better is that if we won the Team Round (lol). But in all seriousness, at least they didn't get their competition tests leaked (*cough* MAA *cough*)
