<!-- Passions -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Passions</h2>
    <p>
        I am a math student who has succeeded and won awards in prestigious math comepetitions like the AMC series, AIME, ARML, MathCounts, CML, Math League, and others. I also enjoy science and has won tournaments like the Logistem Science Challeger, Science Bowl, and others. I'm also starting to get into competitive programming, and I code projects available to the public on my domain. I work on mostly web dev, but I also write lots of python code and am interested in cybersecurity. Besides from all my STEM stuff, I also enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, playing tennis, playing ice hockey, and watching movies.
    </p>

<!-- Math -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>
        My main passion is math, where I captain my school's Math Competition Team (4th in chapter), am a 3x AMC 8 honor roll achiever, was top 10 in my chapter for MathCounts, was #1 in NJ with my team for CML, achieved a perfect score on the Math League competition, and is a Gauss Math Tournament top scorer. My favorite subjects within math are Algebra and Combinatorics. I also am involved on Art of Problem Solving, where I host a blog and occasionally play AoPS For The Win (FTW). I'm interested in participating in high school math competitions next school year (I am a rising Freshman). I am also the founder of IntrepidMaths, which is a group of ~30 people who engage in math discussions.

<!-- Science -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sciences</h2>
    <p>
        I'm also really interested in science, and I captain my school's Science Bowl Team (2nd in state), was a 2x Logistem top 10 scorer, and a 2x NJ Science Bowl runner-up. My main focuses in science would by in Physical Sciences and Earth and Space Sciences. I enjoy physics because of the mathematical aspects of it, and I enjoy earth and space sciences thanks to Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, where I am a major QOTW provider in their discord. I'm also just interested in any type of science, and I like to read scientific books and articles, such as Kurzgesagt's "Immune". I am interested in participating in Science Bowl and other science competitions next year in High School as well.

<!-- Coding -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        Coding is a relatively new interest for me, but it's still a major one nonetheless. I am the co-founder of the Bridgewater-Raritan Computer Science Club (BRCS), where I teach Basic Python and Advanced Python to kids in my school who just started learning about coding. I am also part of the 4th place Middle School team at the 2023 Lexington Informatics Tournament. I also make web projects (like this website), and am fluent in Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Typescript, and am learning C, C#, and C++. I am trying to enter into competitive programming, such as USACO and other contests.
    </p>

<!-- Sports -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sports and Music</h2>
    <p>
        I play travel ice hockey as my main sport, and am trying to make my high school team next year. Besides from that, I also play tennis as more of a recreational activity, and am also decent at table tennis. I also play snare drum and marimba in concert band, and I used to play piano.
