    <h2>Passions</h2>
    <p>
        I am a math lover who has succeeded and won awards in prestigious math competitions like the AMC series, AIME, ARML, MathCounts, CI am a math lover who has succeeded and won awards in prestigious math competitions like the AMC series, AIME, ARML, MathCounts, CML, Math League, and others. I also enjoy science and have won tournaments like the Logistem Science Challeger, the Science Bowl, and others. I'm also a 2x hackathon winner and an informatics tournament top scorer, and I create coding projects available to the public on my web domain and GitHub. My interests lie mostly in web development, but I also write lots of raw Python code and am interested in cybersecurity. Besides all my STEM interests, I also enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, playing ice hockey, tennis, table tennis, band instruments, and watching movies.
    </p>

<!-- Math -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p>
        My primary passion is mathematics, where I captain my school's Math Competition Team (4th in Chapter), am a 3x AMC 8 honor roll achiever, was in the top 10 in my chapter for MathCounts, was #1 in my region with my team for CML, achieved a perfect score on the Math League competition, and am a Gauss Math Tournament top scorer. My favorite subjects in math are algebra and combinatorics. I am also involved on Art of Problem Solving, where I host a blog and occasionally play AoPS For The Win (FTW). I'm particularly interested in participating in high school math competitions next year (I am a rising freshman). I also plan to be an intern for LIVE by Po-Shen Loh next year (or maybe even this year). I serve as the founder of IntrepidMaths, which is a group of ~30 people who engage in enriching math discussions on Discord.

<!-- Science -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sciences</h2>
    <p>
        I'm also really interested in science, and I captain my school's Science Bowl Team (2nd in New Jersey), was a 2x Logistem top 10 scorer, and was a 2x NJ Science Bowl runner-up. My main focuses in science would be in the physical sciences and earth and space sciences. I enjoy physics partially because of the mathematical and precise aspects of the field, and I appreciate earth and space sciences thanks to Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell, where I am a major Question of the Week provider on their Discord server. I'm also just interested in any type of science, and I like to read scientific books and articles, such as Kurzgesagt's "Immune". I am interested in participating in the Science Bowl and other science competitions next year in high school as well.
    </p>

<!-- Coding -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
        Computer Science is a relatively new interest for me, but it's still a major one nonetheless. I am a co-founder of the Bridgewater-Raritan Computer Science Club (BRCS), where I teach Basic Python and Advanced Python to students in Bridgewater-Raritan who are passionate about coding and computer science. I have been a hackathon winner in both the 2023 BR Hackathon and RidgeHacks 2024, and I've been featured on newspaper posts due to my programming achievements. I am also part of the 4th-place middle school team at the 2023 Lexington Informatics Tournament. I enjoy making web projects (like this website), am fluent in Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and am learning C, C#, and C++. As for hackathons, I am primarily a front-end developer, but I am also capable of working on design, databases, and some back-end work. In addition, I have some experience with robotics competitions and have a basic knowledge of robotics. I am trying to enter into competitive programming competitions, such as USACO.    </p>

<!-- Sports -->
<div class="container p-4">
    <h2>Sports, Music, and Humanities</h2>
    <p>
        My primary sport is ice hockey, where I play for the NJ Rockets U15 AA and Bridgewater-Raritan Middle School. Besides hockey, I also play tennis and soccer as recreational activities. I also enjoy playing table tennis with friends. I play snare drum and marimba in my school's concert band, and I used to play piano as well. I'm also a fluent Chinese speaker and enjoy learning about Chinese culture and history. I have won numerous awards for Chinese speaking, along with 3x Class Honors from Huaxia Chinese School.
